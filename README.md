# Obhijog — Municipal Complaint & SLA Tracking

**অভিযোগ** — *obhijog*, Bangla for "complaint".

A civic complaint desk with SLA tracking and automatic escalation.

Citizens report civic issues — a broken streetlight, a water leak, uncollected garbage — with a
photo and a location. Each complaint is routed to a department by its category, which also fixes the
SLA window for that kind of issue. A department admin assigns it to staff, who work it and resolve
it. Every complaint runs against a deadline, and when that deadline is missed the system escalates
automatically and notifies the people responsible.

**Stack:** .NET 9 Minimal APIs · EF Core 9 · Azure Database for PostgreSQL · Angular 20 (standalone + signals +
Material) · Azure Blob Storage · Bicep · GitHub Actions

## What is actually interesting here

Not the CRUD. Three things:

1. **One guarded state machine.** A complaint cannot move except through a single twelve-row
   transition table that encodes the target state, who may perform the action, and what data the
   action requires. There is one `POST /complaints/{id}/transitions` endpoint, so no route can
   bypass it.
2. **An idempotent SLA sweeper.** A periodic sweep raises warnings at 80%, breaches at 100% and a
   second escalation level at 150%. It can run any number of times — by timer, by hand, or from a
   redelivered queue message — without ever double-escalating or double-notifying.
3. **Strict role scoping.** Three roles, one department boundary, and the rule that a complaint
   outside your scope is *indistinguishable from one that does not exist* — `404`, never `403`.

## Documentation

| Document | What it is |
|---|---|
| [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) | The authoritative product and technical specification: domain model, state machine, API surface, authorization invariants, and the milestone roadmap. Code that disagrees with it is a bug in one of the two. |
| [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) | Working rules for agents and contributors — the non-negotiables, the commands, the testing bar. |
| [.claude/skills/feature-cycle](.claude/skills/feature-cycle/SKILL.md) | How one issue goes from pick to merged PR. |
| [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) | Decisions costly to reverse. |

## Roles

| Role | Sees | Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Citizen** | only their own complaints | submit, comment, attach photos, confirm or reopen a resolution, track by reference number without logging in |
| **Staff** | every complaint in their department | start and resolve the ones assigned to them, comment including internal notes |
| **Dept Admin** | every complaint in their department | assign, reassign, recategorize, reject, close; manage categories and SLA hours; manage department staff; dashboard, breach list, CSV export |

## Status

**M4 of 10 is done.** The solution skeleton, CI gate, Angular shell, compose stack, health
endpoints, the full data model with its migration, an idempotent seeder, JWT authentication with
the three roles, and complaint submission are in place: a citizen files a complaint, gets a
reference number and an SLA deadline, and anyone holding that reference can track it without an
account. Complaints cannot be moved between statuses yet — that is M6.
[SPEC.md §20](SPEC.md#20-delivery-roadmap) is the live progress tracker — ten milestones, each one
issue and one pull request.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: **.NET 9 SDK**, Node 20+, Docker Desktop.

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d   # PostgreSQL 17 + Azurite
dotnet run --project src/Obhijog.Api               # http://localhost:5080
npm ci --prefix web && npm start --prefix web      # http://localhost:4200
```

Configuration keys, and the four things that must change together when the API port changes, are in
[SPEC.md §19](SPEC.md#19-configuration--environments). No secret ever lands in a committed file:
`SEED_PASSWORD` comes from the environment, and seeding fails loudly without it rather than planting
a known password.

### The gate

```bash
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
dotnet build --configuration Release      # warnings are errors
dotnet test  --configuration Release
npm ci --prefix web && npm run build --prefix web
```

CI runs exactly this against a real PostgreSQL service container on the commit that will merge.
